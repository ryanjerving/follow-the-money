### Cities and the Wealth of States

When we were challenged at the beginning of this course to come up with a "data story" worth telling, I had a pretty good idea tof what that story would be for me. As I wrote to the discussion board:

> I live in Milwaukee, Wisconsin: a city that -- like a lot of former Rust Belt industrial powerhouses -- is very challenged these days as it tries to fund all the things its people need (schools, police, parks, garbage pickup, lead pipe mitigation, transit infrastructure, etc.). We also often find ourselves stereotyped by the rest of the state as a drain on shared resources. But, in fact, Milwaukee, like urban areas in general, is a net creator rather than a net taker of tax revenues.[...] 

> So I'd like to try to visualize this in a way that can effectively make this simple point: cities generate more wealth than they spend. 

And my hand-drawn illustration of how I might make that point visually looked like this:

I'd read an article recently

Wisconsin Dept. of Revenue data for 2015 shows a regional disparity in the amount of State revenue collected by county and the amount returned as aid to local governments. Toggling between these two map views reveals, dramatically, how revenue earned in the more urban Southeast third of the state is redistributed to the less urban Northwest third (with the Milwaukee city region seeing a particularly large gap).
